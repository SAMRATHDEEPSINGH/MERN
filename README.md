# MERN Learning Journey

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) repository! This repository is a collection of small tasks and projects that I have built while learning the MERN tech stack, starting from basic JavaScript to advanced concepts in frontend and backend development.

## Overview

This repository is structured to showcase my journey of mastering the MERN stack through practical implementation. Each folder contains a specific task or project that helped me understand different aspects of the technology.

Projects

Project 1: Theme Changer Card

A simple application to switch themes using a card interface. This project helped me grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript and React.js, along with implementing state management using useState and useContext.


Project 2: Todo

A task manager application to keep track of daily tasks. This project further solidified my understanding of CRUD operations and connecting a React frontend with a Node.js and Express backend using MongoDB as the database.


Project 3: Video Streaming Application

A video streaming application that enabled me to learn and implement backend concepts such as RESTful APIs, JWT for authentication and authorization, file uploads using multer, and uploading files to Cloudinary. I also focused on creating reliable models and writing robust code to ensure correct entries in the MongoDB database.


Lessons Learned

Through these projects, I have gained a solid understanding of:

# Basic JavaScript and frontend development with React.js

# Implementing state management using useState, useContext, and Redux

# Setting up and configuring a MERN stack application

# Implementing RESTful APIs with Express and Node.js

# Managing state and handling user interactions in React

# Working with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval

# Integrating authentication and authorization with JWT

# Handling file uploads with multer and Cloudinary

# Making reliable models and ensuring data integrity in MongoDB


Future Plans
I plan to continue building more complex projects and delve deeper into advanced topics such as:

# GraphQL integration

# Advanced state management with Redux

# Performance optimization and testing
# Microservices architecture
